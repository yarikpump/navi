		<p> Natus Vincere (Latin for "born to win", often abbreviated to NAVI and previously Na`Vi) is an Ukrainian professional esports organization.
			<br>They were the first team to win all Counter-Strike Majors in one calendar year, with Intel Extreme Masters IV, ESWC 2010, and WCG 2010,<br>
			and the first team to win a Global Offensive Major without dropping a map, doing so at 
			PGL Major Stockholm 2021. </p>

		<h1 align="center">History </h1>
		<h3 align="center">Overview</h3>
		<p>Natus Vincere was founded on 17 December 2009. After the collapse of Ukrainian team KerchNET, the former players of the team were supported by a well-known maecenas and organizer of e-sports tournaments, 
		Murat "Arbalet" Tulemaganbetov. The new team got the name "Arbalet UA". 
		<br>It was composed of Danylo "Zeus" Teslenko and Ivan "Edward" Sukharev from Kharkiv, Sergey "starix" Ischuk from Kyiv, Arsenij "ceh9" Trunozhenko from Lviv and Yegor "markeloff" Markelov from Dnipropetrovsk.</p><br>

		<p>On August 15, Na`Vi won the Ukrainian qualifications for the World Cyber Games and got a paid voucher to the finals in Los Angeles from September 30 to October 3, 2010. 
			The next tournament for Na`Vi was ASUS Summer 2010, to which the team<br> received a direct invitation. This tournament became first in the ASUS Open series, which was held at Kyiv gaming centre "Kyiv CyberSport Arena". 
			In the semi-finals, Na`Vi lost to Kazakh team k23 and as a result, took the 3rd place.
			<br>On October 4, 2010, Natus Vincere became the World Cyber Games world champions by defeating Danish team mTw.dk in the finals. 
			This victory made Na`Vi the first team in the world which had managed to hold the three most prestigious <br>championship titles at once (IEM, ESWC, WCG). At the end of October 2010, 
			ESL TV commentator Bakr "KinGSaicx" Fadl proclaimed that SK Gaming was going to invite the Ukrainian team to take place of its Swedish squad, but the manager of <br>Natus Vincere declined this information.
			In early November 2010, Natus Vincere took part in WEM 2010, which annually gathers the best teams from all over the world in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. Among eight participants of the tournament, 
			<br>Na`Vi took 4th place as well as $7,500.</p><br>
		<h3 align="center">Finding success in CS:GO (2014)</h3>
		<p>The beginning of the year begun with Na`Vi attempting to qualify for the EMS One: Katowice 2014 major, which had three stages for the team to make it to the second major; four open qualifiers; regional finals; 
		followed by online finals, competing against the rest of the European teams attempting to qualify. Na`Vi would qualify but would be blown out of the water again by the likes of Clan-Mystik and LGB eSports.
		Na`Vi did not give up on their lineup, as they would eventually go on to win StarLadder StarSeries IX against the Ninjas in Pyjamas. They initially failed to qualify for said finals by just one game in the round robin, 
		but were called in to replace Fnatic due to them pulling out of the finals. Their form would continue to 
		improve and they would eventually make the playoffs of ESL One: Cologne 2014, ESL's first event at the cathedral of Counter-Strike, achieving a top eight finish and automatically receive an invite to DreamHack Winter 2014.
		The end of the year would see Na`Vi place top four at ESWC 2014 (a fourth place finish) as well as the DreamHack Winter 2014 major.</p><br>

		<p>Na'Vi started off the year by winning DreamHack Open Leipzig 2016 2-0 over Luminosity Gaming on January 22. Na'Vi placed 3rd-4th at the Intel Extreme Masters X - World Championship. On April 3, Na'Vi placed second at 
		MLG Major Championship: Columbus 2016, losing 0-2 to Luminosity Gaming in the finals. During the major, GuardiaN would reveal that he was having wrist pains which saw him struggle towards the end of the tournament. 
		He would be sidelined briefly heading into DreamHack Masters Malm√∂ 2016, which starix would stand-in for the group stage with GuardiaN joining up by the start of the playoffs. Na`Vi would lose this event to 
		Ninjas in Pyjamas who had the home crowd advantage. Na'Vi got second at the StarLadder i-League Invitational #1 after losing to Virtus.pro in the finals on May 22. 
		Na'Vi placed 5-8th at ESL One: Cologne 2016 at the helm of eventual finalists, Team Liquid, boasting fellow Ukrainian star player Oleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev. On July 29, the team placed 3rd-4th at ELEAGUE Season 1.
		On August 4, s1mple would replace Danylo "Zeus" Teslenko on the active roster. The addition of s1mple also marks the first Ukrainian player signing within the Counter-Strike division, 
		since the original quintet back in late 2009.Their first result would be a last place exit at StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 2. Their next event would be ESL One: New York 2016, however this would be 
		the first event where starix would be unable to shot call because of new coaching rules put in place by Valve - only allowing coaches to only communicate to their team within four 30-second tactical pauses per map. 
		The event would see seized in-game leading and would see Na`Vi win over Virtus.pro, however the events to come would not end quite the same.</p><br><br>
